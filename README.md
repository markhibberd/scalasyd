### BigDecimal & Doubles

### Programming in the Large

Good architecture frees us to choose the right tools and techniques, allowing
us to adapt easily and concentrate on solving real problems rather than our 
made up ones. In this talk we will run through some stereotypical projects looking 
at the properties of good architectures and how these play into our ability
to adopt better tools like Scala and FP. We will attempt to ground the magical
architecture ponies, with real examples of my past projects where things have 
gone well and probably of more interest where they really have not.


__Mark Hibberd__


### Your First AKKA Cluster

An Akka novice's journey to setting up an Akka cluster for
asynchronous task processing, including gotchas to consider and highlights
of why actors are cool (or not cool).
